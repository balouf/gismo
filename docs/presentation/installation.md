# Installation

## Stable release

To install GISMO, run this command in your terminal:

```console
$ pip install gismo
```

This is the preferred method to install GISMO, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have [pip] installed, this [Python installation guide] can guide
you through the process.

## From sources

The sources for GISMO can be downloaded from the [Github repo].

You can either clone the public repository:

```console
$ git clone git://github.com/balouf/gismo
```

Or download the [tarball]:

```console
$ curl -OJL https://github.com/balouf/gismo/tarball/master
```

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it from the package directory with:

```console
$ pip install .
```
